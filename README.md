# Welcome!

Visit smartercapes.herokuapp.com to use the app. We use CAPE data for the
past 2 years, a clean subset of it can be found in the data.csv file.

## To-do's and ideas
- [ ] Distinguish between summer session and regular quarter courses for time commitment
- [ ] Text box course selection instead of dropdown, allow for ranges/csv
- [ ] Course comparison (compare two courses side by side)
- [ ] GPA booster suggestions
- [ ] Monitor whether courses are being offered during current academic year
- [ ] Deal with prerequisites
- [ ] Search courses by topic/skill (start with math, for example)
- [ ] Show grade distribution histograms for each professor (e.g. hover mouse to show histogram)
